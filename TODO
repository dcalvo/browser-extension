When the extension is installed, it should open a window where the user signs into the Scribe cloud service if they haven’t already in this browser, and is then redirected to a page welcoming the user to the browser extension and explaining how it works. One of our copy writers will write this page.

Whenever the browser is displaying a PDF or image file by itself (i.e. not embedded in a web page), the extension should provide a browser toolbar button to convert the PDF or image with Scribe.

Whenever the browser is displaying a PDF or image either stand-alone or embedded, the extension should add a “Convert with Scribe” option to the browser’s context menu (the right-click menu).

When converting a displayed PDF document or image, the extension should pass the URL of the document or image to Scribe, unless the URL uses the “file:” scheme, in which case the extension should upload the local file.

When the browser initiates a download for a document in a supported format (see below), the extension should ask the user whether to convert the document with Scribe or continue the download. If the user chooses to convert the document with Scribe, the extension should cancel the original download and pass the URL to Scribe.

When the user opens the context menu for a link on a web page, the extension should check whether the path component of the link’s URL ends in the file extension for a supported document format. If it does, then the extension should add a “Convert with Scribe” option to the context menu for that link. This option should pass the link’s URL to Scribe for conversion.

Whenever a user initiates a conversion with Scribe through any of the methods described above, the extension should open Scribe’s conversion UI in a new browser tab.

The extension should be compatible with current versions of Chrome, Firefox, and the new Chromium-based Edge.
