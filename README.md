## Get started

Clone this repository, and then, in this directory:

1. `npm install`
2. `npx webpack`

Your unpacked Chrome extension will be compiled into `dist/`. You can load it into Chrome by enabling developer mode on the "Extensions" page, hitting "Load unpacked", and selecting the `dist/` folder. You can pack the extension into a `.crx` by using the "Pack extension" button on the same page.

Use `npx webpack` to recompile after editing.

## Source layout

The default source layout looks like this:

```
src
├── app
│   ├── background.ts
│   └── content.ts
├── styles
│   └── popup.css
└── ui
    └── popup.tsx
```

## Dist layout

```
dist
├── icons
│   ├── icon128.png
│   ├── icon16.png
│   ├── icon19.png
│   └── icon48.png
├── js
│   ├── background.js
│   ├── content.js
│   └── popup.js
├── manifest.json
└── popup.html
```

`dist` contains the Chrome extension. You can delete `dist`, but there is no need to as it will be cleaned and regenerated by `webpack`.
